      <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
      <li>3 medium carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 tbsp thyme leaves, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1.4l chicken stock</li>
      <li>2300g leftover roast chicken, shredded and skin removed</li>
      <li>200g frozen peas</li>
      <li>3 tbsp Greek yogurt</li>

      <li>squeeze of lemon juice</li>
      <li>cheese scone, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <li>
        Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely
        grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <li>
        Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly
        grated black pepper. Set everything aside.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <li>
        Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the
        water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10
        minutes or until al dente (just cooked).
      </li>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <li>
        Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to
        bruise it.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <li>
        While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. Drop
        50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the
        butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <li>
        Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often,
        until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted its
        flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <li>
        Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift
        it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying
        pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as
        well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 9</h3>
      <li>
        Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back
        for sprinkling over later.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 10</h3>
      <li>
        Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Now quickly pour in
        the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the
        spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but
        doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 11</h3>
      <li>
        Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons
        should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little
        salt, if needed.
      </li>
      <h3>Step 12</h3>
      <li>
        Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or
        bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese
        and a grating of black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before
        serving, splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness
        will be revived.
